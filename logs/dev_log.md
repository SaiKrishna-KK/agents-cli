# Development Log

## Date: September 8, 2024

### Current Status

The Agents CLI project has been updated with LM Studio integration and better testing support. The system now has:

1. Enhanced LLM client with support for:
   - OpenAI API
   - Claude API
   - LM Studio local LLM API
   - Task complexity-based routing

2. Cursor IDE integration for:
   - File operations
   - Terminal management
   - Code editing

3. Testing infrastructure:
   - Mock responses for testing without API access
   - LM Studio connection testing
   - Email validator testing
   - Test runner script

4. CLI commands:
   - `project`: Run a complete project workflow
   - `dev`: Execute developer agent
   - `task`: Execute a general task
   - `code`: Generate code
   - `cursor`: Execute Cursor IDE commands
   - `server`: Run in server mode

### Test Artifacts
The following files were generated during testing and have been added to .gitignore:
- `email_validator.py`: Generated by code generation test
- `hello.py`: Generated by cursor integration test
- `app.py` and `test_app.py`: Generated by Flask app test
- `csv_parser.py`: Generated by code generation test

### Pending Tasks

1. **LLM Streaming Support**
   - Add streaming for LLM responses to provide real-time output
   - Implement typewriter-like effects for terminal output

2. **Better Error Handling**
   - Improve error handling for failed API calls
   - Add better recovery mechanisms when LLMs fail

3. **Enhanced Cursor Integration**
   - Add support for more Cursor IDE features
   - Implement file difference visualization

4. **Configuration Management**
   - Add a configuration wizard for first-time setup
   - Improve environment variable handling

5. **Performance Optimization**
   - Add caching for repeated LLM queries
   - Optimize file operations for large codebases

6. **Documentation**
   - Add docstrings to all functions
   - Create more comprehensive user guides

### Next Steps

1. Implement streaming support in the LLM client
2. Add configuration wizard
3. Create more examples for common use cases
4. Add unit tests for core modules
5. Enhance the server mode with a web dashboard

### Notes

For testing, use `USE_MOCK_RESPONSES=true` to avoid making actual API calls. Run the test suite with `tests/run_tests.sh`.

The LM Studio integration has been configured to work with the default port (1234). If your LM Studio server uses a different port, update the .env file accordingly.
