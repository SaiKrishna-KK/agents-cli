SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a coding assistant that provides step-by-step instructions in JSON format.
Your output should be a JSON object with a "steps" key, which is a list of actions.
Each action is an object with an "action" field and relevant parameters.
Available actions:
- create_venv: {"action": "create_venv", "path": "./venv"}
- install_deps: {"action": "install_deps", "deps": ["package1", "package2"]}
- create_file: {"action": "create_file", "path": "filename.py", "content": "print('...')"}
- run_file: {"action": "run_file", "file": "filename.py", "venv": "./venv"}

If the user requests a project, output the steps in this JSON format. If there's an error, revise steps."""

USER_PROMPT = """I want a small Python script that prints 'Hello, World!' in a virtual environment called './venv'.
The script should be named 'main.py'.
Include steps to create and activate the virtual environment, install any needed dependencies (if any), 
create the file with the code, run it, and verify the output."""
